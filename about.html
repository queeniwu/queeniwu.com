When I was five, footage of China's ShenZhou Six blasting off caught my eye while I was watching the news. From that point on, I wanted to be an astronaut.
However, as I tried to pursue the idea, I couldn't help but focus on the number of disasters in space exploration caused by human error. So I asked myself what I could do to aleviate that.

I chose Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo because there were courses available in human factors psychology and its applications. This I thought would open my eyes to solutions for the problem space I became married with. I soon found the world of digital product design and how that can affect the world in many ways - not just space exploration.
That mission still exists, and is why I get so excited about responsible design with people's lives in mind.
I've interned as a product designer at Shopify - eliminating existing technical barriers of entry for those with an entrepreneurial mindset, as well as Scotiabank - ideating on how to equip Canadian youth with financial literacy no matter their socioeconomic background.

In addition to my interest in ethical design, I'm also a huge advocate for the design community and sharing knowledge.
I lead UW/UX, the University of Waterloo's first and only UX club, fostering the community through events and workshops. I also direct content for UW Blueprint, a philanthropic tech club focused on building products with NGOs. I strongly believe that teaming up with others is a multiplier for long-lasting individual impact.

I hope to carry these two major themes of ethical design, and strong design communities into the rest of my design career, where I'd use my skills in research and interaction design to bring both software and hardware solutions to fruition - not just by myself, but with a mighty team to stand with.
It might be a lofty goal, but after all, I've always imagined myself among the stars.
