  At Shopify, I was a product design intern on the <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/flow" target="_blank">Flow</a> team - pioneering what it means for merchants to automate their business by offloading time-consuming, repetitive tasks through a visual development tool. Instead of manually tagging orders or capturing payments, over 2000 of our merchants use Flow to automate 4 million of these tasks on a daily basis.
  <br><br>With a large range of development expereince among our user group, the primary focus is to shrink the learning curve to adopt our product without compromising on more complex and powerful functionalities.

  <h2><b>Projects</h2></b>
  Throughout the term, I've had experience working within Shopify's design system, <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a>, optimizing users' visual experience and reducing cognitive load as the product's features and capabilities become more sophisticated. I work side by side with the development team to hand off and ship features to iteratively improve our users' experience.<br><br>

Notably, I initiated a research project around the topic of trust, conducting both qualitative and quantitative research through user interviews and data analysis on Mode Analytics. The recommendations I made has helped kick off and direct a project spanning into the new year.
<br><br>
I also worked as the sole designer on Flow's integration platform - <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/flow-connectors" target="_blank">Flow Connectors</a>. This feature helps Shopify merchants integrate Flow with the existing app ecosytem, consisting of over 2000+ apps. After our initial launch in September, I created iterative designs for both short-term and long-term success based on beta feedback and analysis of how users approach our product. This project revolved around understanding the needs of third-party developers on Shopify, merchant behavior, as well as internal constraints of Shopify's partner platform. My work designing for user growth to scale the Connectors development expereince has driven the number of integrations built from 8 to 21 within my term there, and this number continues to grow.

  <b>Unfortunately, I cannot share full details about the features I'm currently working on yet, but would love to chat more about my process if given the chance.</b>
